**Note:** Major issues or feature requests should be filed on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mono/website/issues) first, so we can discuss the implications.

If you want to edit a page, the easiest way is to click the ![Edit page on GitHub](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1376924/3712375/a6d7bc42-150f-11e4-9ceb-5230cbbfba3f.png) link under the page title on the website.

This will open the source file on GitHub where you can click the pencil button to start editing:

GitHub's editor shows you both the [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) source as well as a preview of the rendered page:
